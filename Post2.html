  <h2>Progress</h2>
  <video width= "800" src="PostContent/ProjectPrototype.mov" preload controls></video>
  <p>Our front-end and back-end game; teams have been hard at work for the past few weeks, here's a video show casing the functionality of the game so far!</p>
  <h2>Login & Profile</h2>
  <img src="PostContent/Profile.png" width= "800">
  <img src="PostContent/ProfileSettings.png" width= "800">
  <p>For the alpha version, we've kept things simple so that the main gameplay of CharacterConnect will be available by Decemeber. As shown, a basic login screen is available for players to sign in, with profiles being customisable in the upper right profile, along with the logout button.</p>
  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <img src="PostContent/Post2.png" width= "800">
  <p>The core gameplay of CharacterConnect will involve creating words with assigned character pieces to earn points. As of the moment, character are assigned and can be placed on the interactive game board, alongside a semi-working chat. </p>
  <h2>What's to Come?</h2>
  <p>By the alpha release, we're planning to fully implement a fully functional 2 player experience, including both a turn-based, and scoring system so that you, our players will be able to experience a competitive match of CharacterConnect with your friends.</p>
  <p>The main focus for the time being is a working game for the players to try out, however other members within the team are simulateously working on additional functionality including both the chat, and leaderboard system, so if we're lucky we will be able to see them in the alpha version. Additionally, we've finally assembled our graphics team, so please look forward to our next update.</p>
